         * \brief This is a simple binarization algorithm.
         * 
         * This algorithm will binarize your image using manual thresholds provided when you create the algorithm.
         * You can either provide one threshold (pixels with value < threshold will be black, other pixels will be white)
         * or you can provide two thresholds.
         *
         * If you provide two thresholds, the pixels with value between the two thresholds will be white, other pixels will be black.
         * If you want to invert this behavior, you can do so at construction.
         *
         * Arity : 1 \n
         * Input type : GrayscaleImage_t<D> \n
         * Output type : GraysaleImage_t<D> \n
         * Complexity : O(n*m) with n and m being the width and height of the image.
         *
         * \tparam D the depth of the input and output image
