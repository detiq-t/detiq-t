     * \brief This class is used to open an image file. The user of ImageIn should never have to use it directly, as it is used by Image's constructor/save methods.
     *
     * This class is abstract, and is an interface to concrete classes representing different image file formats (png, jpg...).
     * Every method writing or reading in a file will use classes implementing this interface, so that it can prepare its data regardless of the file format being used.
     *
     * To add a new format to ImageIn, follow these steps :
     * -# Add an item into the ImageFile::Format enum representing the new format.
     * -# Create a class deriving from ImageFile and reimplement the methods defined in it.
     * -# Update the two methods in ImageFileFactory.cpp so they are able to handle your new file format.
     *
     * The file format will then be available to use within the Image classes.
