     * \brief Implementation of a graph using linked lists of the edges between each vertex.
     *
     * An implementation of a graph with an adjacency matrix would have needed a large amount of memory 
	 * in order to represent a graph applied to an image in which each vertex is a pixel and its edges 
	 * link to the pixel's neighbours. A 100x100px image would have required 10000 vertices, which means a 
	 * 10000*10000 matrix for the edges, it is far too big when there are actually just a few edges for each vertex.
	 * That's why here the graph is implemented with a linked list of the edges for each vertex. 
	 * As a result, the time needed to find an edge capacity is a little higher than with an adjacency 
	 * matrix (but not much since there are just a few edges per vertex), but the saving in memory is very significant.
