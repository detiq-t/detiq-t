/*
 * JPEG ERROR HANDLING EXPLANATION
 *
 * The standard JPEG library exit the program when a fatal error occurs
 * That's not what we want, we would rather raise an exception,
 *  so we need to override the standard JPEG error routine.
 * The only way to do so, is by using low level old school C.
 * So we need to define a structure and a handler.
 * The jpegErrorManager structure is the same as jpeg_error_mgr
 *  but with an additionnal field : setjmp_buffer
 * The setjmp_buffer always store the address where we need to jump
 *  to continue the execution, see setjmp for more informations.
 * The jpegErrorExit function is the error handler.
 * We tell JPEG to call jpegErrorExit when a fatal error occurs
 *  and we give it a jpegErrorManager instead of a jpeg_error_mgr
 * When an error occurs, JPEG call jpegErrorExit and give it
 *  as a parameter a structure wich contains a pointer to the
 *  jpeg_error_mgr structure previously allocated.
 * But this pointer do not only point to a jpeg_error_mgr structure,
 * but also to a jpegErrorManager structure, so we just have to cast it
 * in order to get the setjmp_buffer wich contains the address where we need to jump.
 * It may looks like a makeshift job to a C++ developper but it is the official way.
